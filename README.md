# Tweet A Ball

## What's Tweet A Ball
TaB is a machine meant to decorate spherical objects (balls) starting from a text message.

Differently from other Eggbots, TaB is totally autonomous and doesn't need a PC nor to define the decoration pattern, nor for managing the hardware.

TaB is connected to the net and it can generate decoration patterns from messages coming from the main social networks
