# Project description.
Tweet A Ball (TaB) is a robot designed to "draw" the text of tweets containing specific hashtags on balls, eggs and other spherical surfaces.

Unlike other Eggbot and similar, TaB is fully autonomous and does not require an external control station (PC) or software for processing text draw.
